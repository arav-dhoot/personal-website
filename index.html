            <div class="card-content">Alright, so you clicked here because you wanted to know more about me than listed in the short descriptors below. Don't worry, you won't be disappointed. <br><br> I am Arav (sigh, not again) and I am an alumni of Neerja Modi School and an undergrad at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. I have lived most of my life off the coast of East Africa in the beautiful city of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. A majority of the remainder of the life I remember has been spent in the Pink City, Jaipur. <br><br> I enjoy everything related to computer science. I have spent most of my time dabbling with computer vision, but I'm hoping to explore NLP and generative algorithms as well. I equally enjoy reading about the risks posed by AI and ways to mitigate them.</div>

            <div class="sub-div-content">Projects</div>
            <div class="card-content">I have worked on multiple projects over the past few years. So as to not bore you with the details, I will briefly describe a few projects that I have found most fulfilling. 
                <br><br>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li><b>COMForce: </b>It is the first device to detect the quality and maturity of compost simultaneously. I used a computational approach to provide reliable information to farmers quickly. I had to learn how to use RPi for this project. While then tiring, it was a rewarding process building the entire dataset to scratch.</li>
                    <li><b>Remote PD Detection: </b>I built a program to detect and classify the severity of Parkinson's Disease using in-the-wild video (first program to achieve this) while achieve state of the art performance. I had a lot of fun working on this project and presenting it and collecting the award for it at ISEF (subtle brag, I know).</li>
                    <li><b>Transformer Optimization: </b>I trained GPT-2 on GLUE tasks and monitored the gradients of each of the layers while training. To improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance, I trained an optimized model (freezing layers with lower variance and, thus, learning). I achieved some interesting and promising results. Shoot me an email to discuss more about this project.</li>

            <div class="sub-div-content">Miscellaneous</div>
            <div class="card-content">I didn't know what to add here. So spoil yourself with these interesting etymological facts. <br><br>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>The word 'guy' originated from a guy called 'Guy' who tried to burn the English parliament down but failed (how sad ... <em>I mean, thank god</em>).</li>
                    <li>'Peas' used to be the singular for 'peasen'. </li>
                    <li>The word 'avocado' originates from the Spanish word 'aguacate' which comes from the Nahuatl word 'ƒÅhuacatl', which means (just look this up yourself, and don't tell me I didn't warn you).</li>
